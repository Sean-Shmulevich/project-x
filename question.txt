I want to really focus on the block building system, what are the blocks
really made of how does the intuitive brain structure work, how are ideas
connected and encapsulated to make a web that grows and automatically places
conversations in the correct spot on that web of encapsulated ideas where they
belong.

CONCRETE IDEA FOR HOW THE APP WORKS:
When you open up a new convo, you either start from a new context, choose one that you usually use, or choose one that you have created to do a specific purpose.
The brain structure comes in when you then zoom out to see your chat history which is grouped into categories. 
In order to best categorize the history we would probably need some deep learning models, seperate from chatGPT language learning model

Needs to be intuitive
Needs to be powerful

We want it to have a block like structure. 
so you can attach ideas to other ideas. 

how are those ideas classified.

what is a building of inofrmation what consist of.

What is the most intuitive way to build these resusable ideas.

and what about resuable spaces, or revistiable spaces.
If you are having a conversation with

Link a thread to a previos thread. you can choose the boundries of how much context you want to bring in from a potential thread in your history.

what if there was a tab on top that represented stuff that you usally talk about.

It will know what context to use automatically if you randomly ask it a superunrelated quesiton. 

The solution isnt to make a bunch of different threads, the solution is to make like 5 or 6 conversations that represent big ideas.
if know everything you have every asked ift about a specifc topic that you deal with frequently.

All the information for a specifc topic 
What if
