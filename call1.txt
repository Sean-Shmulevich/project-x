For the next week at work I want to write times when I wish this existed. I'll
ask judah to do it too. Or places where it would be power.

- bringing old convos into new ones

1. why doesnt gpt let you get a full history of everything you do with it? 
2. why doesnt openAi allow you to reference another conversation thread?
3. why doesnt openAi allow you to interact with traditional search, it does but not by default 
4. why doesnnt gpt help you generate search queries and help you find the best most reliable resources
5. why arent chatbots somewhere you go for all queries
6. why aren't there any tools that help you organize all of the search you do on bots and on google into a 
non-linear format that is understandable from a wide view.
7. why is finding something in your history like how it is now.
8. why doesnt search history show things in groups of topics you search rather
then showing them based off how recent they are.
9. Why dont people have a way of seeing an overview of their search history
within a specific time period in a cohesive way.
