Block Building System in Chat Companion 2.0
What are Blocks Made Of?
Text Blocks: These could be snippets of conversations, questions, or answers from the chatbot.
Link Blocks: URLs, search results, or YouTube links that are relevant to the conversation.
Note Blocks: User-created notes or annotations.
Task Blocks: To-do items or action steps.
Context Blocks: Metadata that encapsulates the context in which a conversation or idea was formed.
Brain Tree of Information
Root Nodes: These are the "Big Ideas" or overarching topics that you frequently engage with. They serve as the starting point for your Brain Tree.
Branch Nodes: Sub-topics or specific conversations that stem from a Root Node.
Leaf Nodes: The most granular level, consisting of individual blocks.
Intuitive Classification
Automatic Tagging: Utilize NLP to automatically tag and classify blocks based on their content.
User-Defined Tags: Allow users to manually tag blocks for custom classification.
Dynamic Placement: The system should automatically place new blocks in the appropriate location within the Brain Tree based on their classification.
Connecting and Encapsulating Ideas
Drag-and-Drop: Users can intuitively drag and drop blocks to link them to other blocks.
Contextual Linking: The system can suggest potential links between blocks based on their content and metadata.
Encapsulation: Users can encapsulate multiple blocks into a single, higher-level block, which can then be linked to other blocks or nodes in the Brain Tree.
Reusable and Revisitable Spaces
Spaces: Think of these as folders where related blocks and nodes can be stored together.
History and Context: Each space retains a history that can be revisited, allowing users to pick up where they left off.
User Interface Elements
Top Tabs: For quick access to frequent topics or "Big Ideas."
Context Awareness: If a user asks a seemingly unrelated question, the system will automatically know which context or space to use based on past interactions and the current Brain Tree structure.
How to Build Reusable Ideas Intuitively
Templates: Offer templates for common types of blocks (e.g., a template for brainstorming, a template for project planning).
Quick Actions: Implement quick actions like "Link to Existing Node," "Create New Node," "Add to Space," etc., to make the process faster and more intuitive.
Architectural Considerations
Scalability: The system should be designed to handle an ever-growing Brain Tree without performance issues.
Searchability: Implement a robust search algorithm to quickly locate blocks, nodes, or spaces.
Privacy and Security: All data should be encrypted, and the user should have full control over who can access their Brain Tree.
By focusing on these elements, the block-building system in Chat Companion 2.0 can offer an intuitive yet powerful way for users to manage their conversations and ideas. It will serve as a dynamic, growing web of interconnected thoughts, automatically organizing itself to best suit each user's unique needs.
