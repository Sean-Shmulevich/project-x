Imagine you had the option while using chatGPT to get the 10 most perfect
search results online for the topics you were asking about. Not just search
results but also youtube links. things that can maybe back up its responce and
give you good insight when you are looking for things like responses from real
people. You can even just use it as something on top of a search engine that
helps you understand the information you are actually looking for. In other
words making sure you understand the answer and the question before you start
actaully trying to google seasrch. 

this is an improvement over the regular way of search right now because the old
way of doing search before gpt is that you iterate search querys into google
until you get closer to understanding why you are wrong given small hints and
context clues and understanding what you are missing. gpt queries are kind of
the opposite of that you fill in the information that you dont understand until
you educate yourself to understand the answer. But sometimes in the peak of
that understanding of your question I would appreciate a google check
especially if there is a way to craft a small amount links that are all super
relevent and helpful.
