Imagine you had the option while using chatGPT to get the 10 most perfect
search results online for the topics you were asking about. Not just search
results but also youtube links. things that can maybe back up its responce and
give you good insight when you are looking for things like responses from real
people. You can even just use it as something on top of a search engine that
helps you understand the information you are actually looking for. In other
words making sure you understand the answer and the question before you start
actaully trying to google seasrch. 

this is an improvement over the regular way of search right now because the old
way of doing search before gpt is that you iterate search querys into google
until you get closer to understanding why you are wrong given small hints and
context clues and understanding what you are missing. gpt queries are kind of
the opposite of that you fill in the information that you dont understand until
you educate yourself to understand the answer. But sometimes in the peak of
that understanding of your question I would appreciate a google check
especially if there is a way to craft a small amount links that are all super
relevent and helpful.

If you end up viewing a webpage you can add the text content of the website to
the conversation and you will forever be able to refernce the content of the
website in all of the conversations that are in that topic group

sometimes gpt need to add simplicity and step back to solve a problem instead
of adding complexity to solve a problem. it gets stuck in a loop like this
sometimes

Deep learning model to the for autocorrecting when the user writes prompts

possibly use two plugins for one query like one to get the data from some website and one to generate something based off that website.
ex: read documentation and run code.


integrate a tool for sending get and post requests to api endpoints. So basically the "Postman app" but the querys are generated by gpt.

it could also maybe connect to your browser and understand your search
results/questions and provide itself with prompts you can ask it to answer your
question with gpt. So like a chrome extention connected to our app

right now when you use chat gpt you sometimes need to ask questions that it has
already answered but you dont want to try to have to find the conversation
again

Provide context of a large dataset (like a textbook) and it will scan your
large dataset for tokens that match your prompt or it will look in the
locations that you tell it to.

Sometimes gpt gets stuck in a loop where its base solution is incorrect and it
iterates on that solution, increasing its complexity when in reality the best
solution is to step back and consider new solutions

The prompting should have prompting in it. When you prompt chat gpt you mini
actions that you do to enhance your prompt. Maybe a list of mini actions you
can do on your prompt.

Graph like structure of everything that you use gpt for, different sections of
the graph represent different topics you use gpt for. 

As you zoom in you see more specific details of groups and topics of
conversations. 

As you zoom out you see more general topics and groups of conversations.

A tool for people to change the structure of how they are connected to human
information 

We can insert prompts in the background of the conversations saying a structure
for how to generate something, Ex: A venn diagram. then we can take the output
and generate the ven diagram ourselvs. 

You can create workflows that for example create worksheets based off a
specific textbook. this could be a great tool for teachers and students. kind
of like an ai bot structure.

you should be able to reuse bits of conversations that you have have in the
past or ones that you use often.

sometimes when you are learning with chatgpt you start with a question and a
broad goal of something you want to accomplish. 

You ask a question with the
intent of learning, and solving a problem that you maybe dont know that much
about yet you need to zoom into information and take a specific path through gpt to get the answer you want and understand the answer in the process. 
zooming into information would be an intuative way to do this.

Really good way to store and look at overview of conversations.

Block building system. 

Different workspaces with AI,s that had different purposes, different default history/contexts. 

Identity workspace threads

Copy and paste bits of context into new conversations

Not sure exactly how the block building system would work but that would really determine if its user friendly or not 

Generate .sh files for deployment with certain context about your filesystem

Possibly trie like structrure for a block.
